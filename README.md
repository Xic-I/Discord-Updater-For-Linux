Some days I have "trouble" updating my Discord App on Linux, because the Discord doenst update like it does on Windows (on Linux you need to go to a website, download a .deb file
and then install it to use the app) so, I created this updater to automate the update process the app.

I thought it might be useful for most linux users so I decided to share the script on my GitHub.
